# ** Hello fellow BecodIAn! ** :octocat:

The story starts among the fog of *Machu Pichu* Mountain. :sparkles:  :sparkles:  :sparkles:

Once uppon a time a little village used to organize Heavy metal concert that you could hear from several miles away.

It was called the :metal: **HELL o WORLD Festival** :metal: and people from all around the planet were joining it! :earth_americas:

At the gates of this festival Satan was awaiting. Tickets cost only one **Soul**.

There was a strict door policy. It was definetely harder to get in than the Capitol. 

A zombie came, wanting to enter but had no soul left.
He was thinking: "Mmh ... I only have one possibility".
And so he called The QAnon shaman to break the door down!
